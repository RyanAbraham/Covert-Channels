# Contributing

When making changes, please first either find the corresponding JIRA issue or create it if it does not exist.

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER, please branch and PR any changes to master. This gives an opportunity for others to both code review your work and also see changes going into master, as opposed to new code simply appearing.

## Branch Naming

As you now have a JIRA issue tied to your changes, name your branch after your JIRA ticket number, and optionally a word or two after that describing the ticket.

`CC-42/fix-submit-button`
